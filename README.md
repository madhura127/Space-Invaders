# Space-Invaders
To design and build one of the earliest video games,’ SPACE INVADERS’ using  pygame , a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, implementing some of the the main game development concepts like moving characters, shooting bullets, and more

	Abstract :

Space Invaders is a well known game among children even among matured people.
The objective of Space Invaders, which was one of the earliest video games released, is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen.

Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers

Used for :
Assigning random posistions to enemy elements within given boundaries.

•	math module

The math module is a standard module in Python and is always available. To use mathematical functions under this module, you have to import the module using import math.
Used for :
To import mathematical functions like pow() , sqrt() to calculate the distance between elements.
